README

Welcome to the negative(-11) PHP MVC Framework.
You are using version 2 (Chocolate).

Features
--------
Lightweight MVC PHP Framework.
Namespace autoloading
Straightforward and easy to use. No complex setup.
Free and Open Source.
Only the basics for MVC. Add more bells and whistles via packages system.

Learn More
----------
You should check out the wiki for more information:
https://github.com/negative11/negative11-chocolate/wiki

There you will find detailed installation and setup instructions.

Requirements
------------
PHP Version 5.3+
Apache Web Server with mod_rewrite enabled (if using included .htaccess file).

Basic Installation
------------------
It's very easy to get started.

1. Set application directory as your website root. It is recommended that you keep all other folders
outside of the public web directory.
2. Open index.php and modifiy contents. Follow instructions for specifying environment paths and packages.
3. Open your browser and point to website. If you have everything configured correctly, you should see
the framework information page.
4. If you have difficulties, refer to the full installation guide in the wiki.

Common Problems
---------------
If you get a 500 error when trying to load the framework, it is possible that mod_rewrite is not enabled. Check your Apache configuration.

If you don't see the framework page, ensure that you specified your paths correctly in index.php, and that the user
running Apache has the correct permissions to load the files. 

Apache Issues
-------------
If you see a 404 page when loading website for the first time, ensure that the ENVIRONMENT_ROOT in index.php is defined to the absolute path of the folder that contains
the system and packages folders. 

Ensure that mod_rewrite is enabled and that your .htaccess is set to the values provided. 

Your Apache virtual host must be set up to point the accessed domain at the appropriate folder, as the .htaccess file uses '/' as the RewriteBase (@see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritebase for more information regarding RewriteBase).

Sample Apache Virtual Host
--------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/example/
  ServerName example.com
  <Directory /var/www/example/>
    allow from all
    Options +Indexes
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
